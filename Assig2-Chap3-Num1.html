    <h1>All About Me</h1>
    <p> My name is Solomon Gebreslasie and I was born on the 8th of November, 1987 in Axum, Ethiopia. My parents were Legese Gebreslasie and Desta Gebremedhin. I am in the middle of four younger siblings and four older siblings from the same parent. I have lots of unforgettable fun and memories with my family members besides they play a big role for who I am todayThe base for my childhood education was my Father. He was a priest in the Ethiopian Orthodox Church and he teaches kids (3-7 ages) of the neighborhood community about the basic for the local education called Fidel. This replaces kindergarten school and I am part of this system. </p>
    <br>
    <p>When successfully completed this stage at the age of seven, I attend my primary school in Abrha We Atsbha   and my secondary school in Axum secondary school. After high school graduation, I join for college degree in one of the oldest universities in Ethiopia called Haramaya University. I was selected to be a university graduate assistant in one of the largest governmental higher institutions during the time of graduation ceremony based on my top-grade performance. With respect to computer science experience as higher institution employee, I start to attend lots of short trainings organized by the computer science department. Accordingly, I gain lots of basic experience of computer science. With this idea in mind I heard about Masters in Software Development program from a friend graduated from Maharishi University of Management.  Then I apply for the program and get accepted. Currently I am august 2019 entry student in Maharishi University of Management. Hopefully this shift will play a big role in my future success.</p>
